fader - the physical slider controls different parameters for each group (essential for dub mixing!)

the fader affects the currently selected group (A, B, C, or D)

select what the fader controls:
hold [fader] + press a pad to choose:
- level: group volume (default) - ride levels for dub mixing
- pitch: tune the entire group up/down
- LPF: low-pass filter (removes highs) -ESSENTIAL for dub!
- HPF: high-pass filter (removes lows)
- attack: how sounds fade in
- release: how sounds fade out
- pan: stereo position (left/right)
- FX send: how much goes to the delay/reverb - for echo throws!

record fader motion:
hold [rec] + move fader while playing
automation records to the pattern - plays back automatically

classic dub techniques with fader:
- LPF sweeps on the bass for underwater effects
- ride levels to drop elements in and out
- control FX send to throw sounds into delay
- automate everything for that live dub mix feel
