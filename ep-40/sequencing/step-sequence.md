title: "Step Sequencing"
---

step sequencing - program notes one step at a time, like classic drum machines

how it works:

1. enter main mode
   - press [main]
   - display shows your position (bar.beat.subdivision)

2. navigate to a step
   - use [-/+] to move forward/backward
   - resolution depends on your [timing] setting

3. add a note
   - hold [rec] + press a pad
   - that sound is now on this step

4. move and repeat
   - press [+] to go to next step
   - keep adding notes

remove a note:
hold [erase] + press the pad

important difference from other gear:
- [rec] + pad = add
- [erase] + pad = remove
- it's not a toggle

preview steps:
when stopped, [-/+] lets you hear what's on each step
