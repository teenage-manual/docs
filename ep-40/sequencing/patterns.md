title: "Patterns Explained"

pattern - a recorded sequence for one group (your drum loop, bass line, melody, etc.)

the basics:
- 99 patterns available per group
- each pattern can be 1-99 bars long
- patterns are independent (group A pattern 2 + group B pattern 5 = fine)

see current pattern:
hold the group button - display shows the number

change patterns:
- hold group + [-/+] to scroll
- or hold group + type number on pads (01-99)

change pattern length:
hold [rec] + [-/+] to extend or shorten

copy a pattern to make variations:
1. [shift] + C twice → display shows "PTN"
2. switch to destination pattern number
3. [shift] + D to paste

dub technique: create multiple pattern variations
then switch between them live for that classic dub mixing style
