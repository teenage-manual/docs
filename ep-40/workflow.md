ep-40 organizes music in the same layers as ko ii:

project (9 total) - like a song file, stores everything
- hold [main] + pad 1-9 to load a project
- projects come pre-loaded with reggae/dub sounds

group (4 per project: A, B, C, D) - like instrument sections
- each holds 12 sounds on the pads
- all 4 groups play together as your full riddim
- recommended: A=drums/percussion, B=bass (or synth), C=melodic (horns, keys), D=samples/vocals

pattern (99 per group) - a recorded loop for that group
- hold group button + [-/+] to switch patterns
- each group has its own independent pattern

scene (99 per project) - a snapshot of your arrangement
- remembers which pattern each group is playing
- hold [main] + [-/+] to switch scenes
- [shift] + [main] = commit (create new scene)
