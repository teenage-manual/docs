ep-40 riddim - a reggae/dub-focused sampler in the ko ii family

power on:
1. insert 4x AAA batteries (or USB-C power)
2. slide power switch to turn on
3. press pads to play sounds

what makes ep-40 special:
- 128MB storage pre-loaded with dub/reggae sounds
- built-in bass/lead synthesizer for classic dub bass
- dedicated dub siren for authentic sound system vibes
- 8 artist tracks with separated stems for remixing

workflow is identical to ko ii:
projects → groups → patterns → scenes
same button layout, same shortcuts - just reggae-focused

if you know ko ii (EP-133), you already know ep-40
