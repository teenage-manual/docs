timing - controls how notes align to the grid (essential for tight beats or laid-back grooves)

open timing settings:
press [timing]

quantize mode (Q) - notes snap to grid:
- use [-/+] to set resolution
- 1/16 is standard for most beats
- 1/8 for classic reggae one-drop feel
- 1/8T for triplet feels

free mode (FREE) - no snapping:
- press [-/+] to toggle between Q and FREE
- notes record exactly as you play them

swing - shuffle your beat:
- x-knob: resolution
- y-knob: swing amount (0 = straight, higher = more shuffle)

note repeat - instant rolls:
hold [timing] + press a pad
repeats at current resolution

reggae tips:
- use slight swing for that laid-back reggae feel
- one drop rhythms benefit from swing on the hi-hats
- keep kick and snare tight, let other elements breathe
