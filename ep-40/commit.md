scene - a snapshot that remembers which patterns all 4 groups are playing

why use scenes for dub:
dub is all about "versions" - different mixes of the same riddim
scenes let you prepare those versions and switch between them live

create a scene:
[shift] + [main] (commit)
- duplicates current patterns to new slots
- creates a new scene pointing to them
- now you can make changes without losing the original

switch scenes:
hold [main] + [-/+] to scroll through scenes
scene changes happen at the end of the current bar

dub workflow:
1. scene 1: full riddim (all elements playing)
2. commit → now on scene 2
3. drop the drums, leave bass and effects (dub version)
4. commit → scene 3
5. drums back but vocals chopped differently
6. switch scenes live - this is classic dub mixing!

tip: prepare 4-6 scene variations and mix between them live
