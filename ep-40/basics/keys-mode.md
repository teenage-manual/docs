title: "Keys Mode"
---

keys mode - turns the 12 pads into a chromatic keyboard (essential for bass lines!)

why use this:
- play bass lines with the built-in synth
- play melodic samples chromatically
- horn stabs and keyboard parts

enable keys mode:
1. select a sound (press [sound], pick a pad)
2. press [keys] to turn it on
3. pads now play that sound at different pitches

find your root note:
- hold [keys] - the root pad lights up
- tap [keys] repeatedly to move the root position

change octave:
while in keys mode, [-/+] shifts octaves up/down

change scale:
[shift] + [erase] → navigate to scale setting
- minor and pentatonic work great for reggae
- chromatic if you want all notes available

bass line workflow:
1. select a synth bass sound
2. enable keys mode
3. set scale to minor
4. record your bass line live or step-by-step
