punch-in fx - instant performance effects triggered by holding pads

how to use:
1. start your beat with [play]
2. hold [fx] + press any pad
3. effect applies while you hold
4. release to return to normal instantly

pressure sensitive:
- press harder = more intense effect
- press lighter = subtler effect
- each pad triggers a different effect

effects include:
- filters (low-pass, high-pass sweeps)
- stutter and glitch
- delay throws
- bit crush and lo-fi
- tremolo and pitch effects

combine with other dub tools:
- dub siren for pitched effects
- punch-in fx for rhythmic effects
- master delay for echo throws
- fader automation for filter sweeps

these do NOT record to your pattern
they're purely for live performance - use them to spice up your dub mix
