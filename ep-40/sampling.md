how to sample:
1. press [sample] - pads flash, ready to record
2. set your levels:
   - x-knob: input gain (how loud the input is)
   - y-knob: threshold (when to start recording)
3. hold a pad + make sound (speak, play, etc.)
4. release the pad to stop recording
5. press the pad to hear your sample

sources:
- built-in mic
- 3.5mm line input (phone, turntable, mixer, etc.)

dub sampling ideas:
- vocal snippets and shouts
- sample from vinyl for classic dub vibes
- record live instruments (melodica, guitar, horns)
- environmental sounds for texture
- voice effects through delay

delete a sample permanently:
[erase] + [sound] while on that pad
