title: "Built-in Synthesizer"
---

synth - ep-40 has a built-in bass/lead synthesizer for authentic dub sounds

why use this:
- classic dub bass sound built-in
- no need to sample bass - it's already there
- filter sweeps for that dubby feel

access the synth:
synth sounds are in the factory sample slots
select one and use [keys] mode to play chromatically

playing bass lines:
1. select a synth sound
2. press [keys] to enable
3. pads now play different pitches
4. record a bass line

fader for filter control:
- select the synth group
- set fader to LPF (low-pass filter)
- fader now controls filter cutoff
- great for classic dub filter sweeps

x/y knobs adjust synth parameters
what they control depends on the specific synth sound

tip: layer the synth bass with sampled sounds for huge tracks
