title: "Master Effects"
---

master effect - one global effect that all groups can send to (DELAY is essential for dub!)

ep-40 has ONE master effect slot - for dub, you probably want delay

select your effect:
press [fx] + use [-/+] to choose:
- delay: echo with feedback -THE dub effect
- reverb: adds space and room - also very dubby
- distortion: drive, grit, saturation
- chorus: modulation and widening
- filter: resonant sweeping filter
- compressor: dynamics control, glue

delay for dub (the classic choice):
- x-knob: delay time (sync to tempo for rhythmic echoes)
- y-knob: feedback (how many repeats - automate this!)
- throw vocals and snares into the delay for classic dub

send groups to the effect:
1. select a group (A, B, C, or D)
2. hold [fader], press the FX send pad
3. move the fader to control send amount
4. automate the send for "echo throws"

output compressor (separate from effects):
[shift] + [fx] → OUT page
adds master compression to the final mix
