sound edit - access all parameters for the selected pad's sound

enter sound edit:
[shift] + [sound] (with a pad selected)

pages (navigate with [-/+]):
- SND: play mode (one-shot/key/legato) + stereo pan
- TR: trim start/end points
- EN: envelope (attack/release)
- TIM: time stretch (sync sample to tempo)
- MID: MIDI output channel and root note
- GRP: mute group assignment

quick adjustments (sound mode, no shift):
- x-knob: sound volume/level
- y-knob: pitch (tune up/down semitones)

for fine control:
hold [shift] while turning any knob

mute groups for realistic drums:
put closed hi-hat and open hi-hat in the same mute group
closed hat will cut off open hat (like real hi-hats!)
