live recording - play pads in real-time while the sequencer captures what you do

three ways to start recording:

1. with count-in (recommended for tight timing)
   - tap [rec], then tap [play]
   - you'll hear 4 clicks, then recording starts

2. immediate start
   - press [rec] + [play] together
   - starts right away, no count-in

3. start when you play
   - tap [rec] (it blinks, waiting)
   - hit any pad - recording starts with that note

while recording:
- hit pads to add notes
- press [rec] again to stop recording but keep playing
- press [play] to stop everything

restart from the top:
[shift] + [play]

dub recording tips:
- record the basic riddim tight and quantized
- use fader automation for live filter sweeps
- add siren hits and punch-in fx during performance
