live dub mixing - ep-40 shines for real-time dub performance (this is how classic dub was made!)

setup for live dub:
1. create your riddim scenes (variations prepared in advance)
2. set up fader for LPF control on bass
3. configure delay as master effect
4. set up FX sends for each group
5. practice scene changes

live dub techniques:
- drop drums in/out by switching scenes or muting group A
- filter sweeps on bass (fader → LPF)
- delay throws: boost FX send momentarily, then cut
- dub siren for transitions and hype
- punch-in fx for texture and variety

classic dub workflow:
1. let the riddim play (full mix)
2. ride the faders (filter, level, FX send)
3. drop elements out (drums, bass, etc.)
4. throw sounds into delay
5. bring elements back in
6. hit the siren
7. repeat - each pass is a new "version"

this is authentic dub mixing style - no two performances are the same
