fader - the physical slider controls different parameters for each group

the fader affects the currently selected group (A, B, C, or D)

select what the fader controls:
hold [fader] + press a pad to choose:
- level: group volume (default)
- pitch: tune the entire group up/down
- time: time stretch amount
- LPF: low-pass filter (removes highs)
- HPF: high-pass filter (removes lows)
- attack: how sounds fade in
- release: how sounds fade out
- pan: stereo position (left/right)
- FX send: how much goes to the master effect

visual feedback:
- steady light = currently active parameter
- blinking = has a non-default value stored

reset to default:
[shift] + [fader] toggles the fader's stored value on/off

clear all fader settings:
[erase] + [fader] resets everything for the current group
