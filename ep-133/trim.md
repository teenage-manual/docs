title: "Trim Samples"
---

trimming - set where a sample starts and ends playback

why use this:
- remove silence from the beginning
- cut off unwanted tails
- tighten up drum hits

how to trim:
1. [shift] + [sound] to enter sound edit
2. navigate to TR (trim) page with [-/+]
3. x-knob: start point (where playback begins)
4. y-knob: end point (where playback stops)
5. press the pad to preview your trim

the display shows a visual waveform:
- left edge = start (x)
- right edge = end (y)

for precise trimming:
hold [shift] while turning knobs for fine control

non-destructive:
trimming doesn't delete anything - the original sample stays intact
you're just setting playback boundaries
