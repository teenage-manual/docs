title: "Output Compressor"
---

output compressor - master compression on the final mix (separate from effects)

this is NOT the same as choosing "compressor" in the effects menu
the output comp is always available on top of any effect you choose

access:
[shift] + [fx] → OUT page

controls:
- x-knob (drive): how hard you push into the compressor
- y-knob (speed): attack/release time (fast vs slow response)

why use this:
- glue your mix together (makes everything feel cohesive)
- add punch and loudness
- prevent clipping on the output

settings guide:
- subtle: light drive, medium speed - polished final mix
- aggressive: high drive, fast speed - pumping, in-your-face sound

tip: this is your "mastering" stage - a little goes a long way
