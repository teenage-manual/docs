title: "Keys Mode"
---

keys mode - turns the 12 pads into a chromatic keyboard for any sound

why use this:
- play melodies and bass lines with samples
- create chord progressions
- use any sound as an instrument

enable keys mode:
1. select a sound (press [sound], pick a pad)
2. press [keys] to turn it on
3. pads now play that sound at different pitches

find your root note:
- hold [keys] - the root pad lights up
- tap [keys] repeatedly to move the root position

change octave:
while in keys mode, [-/+] shifts octaves up/down

change scale:
[shift] + [erase] → navigate to scale setting
- chromatic (all 12 notes)
- major, minor, pentatonic, dorian, etc.
- scale limits pads to only "correct" notes

tip: use legato play mode (in sound edit) with keys for smooth bass lines
