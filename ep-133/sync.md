sync - connect multiple devices to play in time together

ko ii has a dedicated sync jack (3.5mm) - this is NOT midi

sync with pocket operators:
- use sync out with a splitter cable
- set ko ii to "dual 8th note" sync mode
- syncs two POs at once from one output

sync with other ko ii / EP units:
- use 16th note sync mode
- daisy chain multiple units together
- includes start/reset signal

sync with vintage drum machines (sync24/DIN sync):
- requires 3.5mm to DIN sync adapter cable
- this is NOT a midi cable (different protocol)

important distinction:
- sync jack = clock pulse for POs and vintage gear
- midi jacks = MIDI protocol for modern gear
- USB = MIDI over USB to computer

access sync settings:
[shift] + [erase] → navigate to sync/clock options
