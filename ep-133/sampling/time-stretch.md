title: "Time Stretching"
---

time stretch - makes samples sync to your project tempo automatically

why use this:
- loops play in time regardless of tempo changes
- match samples from different sources
- speed up or slow down without pitch change

access time stretch:
1. [shift] + [sound] → navigate to TIM page with [-/+]
2. x-knob: selects mode (OFF, BPM, or BAR)
3. y-knob: sets the value

bar mode (BAR) - easier method:
- set how many bars the sample should last
- sample stretches to fit exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 bars
- ko ii does the math for you

bpm mode (BPM) - when you know the source tempo:
- set the original BPM of the sample
- ko ii stretches it to match your project tempo
- need to know or guess the source BPM

example:
1. sample a 2-bar drum loop
2. TIM page → x-knob to BAR, y-knob to 2
3. now that sample plays exactly 2 bars at any tempo
