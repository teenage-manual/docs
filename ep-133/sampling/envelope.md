title: "Envelope (Attack/Release)"
---

envelope - controls how sounds fade in and out over time

attack - how quickly the sound reaches full volume
release - how long the sound fades out after you stop

access envelope:
1. [shift] + [sound] to enter sound edit
2. navigate to EN (envelope) page with [-/+]
3. x-knob: attack (fade in time)
4. y-knob: release (fade out time)

attack settings:
- low/zero: sound starts immediately (punchy drums)
- high: sound fades in slowly (pads, ambient swells)

release settings:
- low: sound cuts off sharply when pad is released
- high: sound fades out gradually (natural decay)

practical uses:
- add attack to soften harsh drum transients
- add release to smooth out abrupt sample endings
- combine for pad-like textures from any sample
