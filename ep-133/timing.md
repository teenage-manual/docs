title: "Timing, Quantize and Swing"
---

timing controls how notes align to the grid - essential for tight beats or loose grooves.

open timing settings:
press [timing]

quantize mode (Q) - notes snap to grid
- use [-/+] to set resolution
- 1/16 is standard for most beats
- 1/8T for triplet feels
- 1/32 for detailed hi-hat patterns

free mode (FREE) - no snapping
- press [-/+] to toggle between Q and FREE
- notes record exactly as you play them
- good for human feel, but can get messy

swing - shuffle your beat
- x-knob: resolution
- y-knob: swing amount (0 = straight, higher = more shuffle)

note repeat - instant rolls:
hold [timing] + press a pad
- repeats at current resolution
- great for hi-hat rolls, snare fills
- record while holding for instant patterns

time correct - fix sloppy recordings:
press [shift] + [timing]
- pads blink showing which have recorded notes
- press a pad to snap its notes to the grid
- hold a pad while playing to quantize in real-time
