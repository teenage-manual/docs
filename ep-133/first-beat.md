title: "Make Your First Beat"
---

let's make something from scratch:

1. load a project with sounds
   - hold [main] + pad 1-5

2. explore the sounds
   - press group A, hit the pads
   - this is where your drums are

3. start recording
   - press [main] to enter main mode
   - tap [rec] - it blinks, waiting
   - tap [play] for a 4-beat count-in
   - (or press [rec]+[play] together to start immediately)

4. punch in your drums
   - hit pads in time with the beat
   - press [play] to stop everything
   - or press [rec] to stop recording but keep playing

5. add more layers
   - switch to group B, record bass
   - switch to group C, add melody

6. save your work
   - press [shift] + [main] to commit
   - this saves your arrangement as a scene
