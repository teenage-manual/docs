title: "Record Fader Motion"
---

fader motion - record fader movements as automation in your pattern

why use this:
- filter sweeps that play back automatically
- volume swells and fades
- pitch rises for build-ups

how to record fader motion:
1. hold [fader], select what to control (filter, pitch, etc.)
2. start playback with [play]
3. hold [rec] + move the fader
4. release [rec] to stop recording
5. automation now plays back with your pattern

erase fader motion:
- [erase] + [fader] erases all fader data for the group
- or record new motion at default/center position (overwrites)

tip: filter sweeps are the classic use - set fader to LPF, record a slow open during a build-up
