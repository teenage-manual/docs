C = copy, D = paste (the buttons above group C and D)

copy/paste a BAR (one bar of a pattern):
1. navigate to the bar you want to copy
2. [shift] + C → display shows "BAR"
3. navigate to destination bar
4. [shift] + D to paste

copy/paste a PATTERN (entire pattern):
1. be on the pattern you want to copy
2. [shift] + C + C (tap C twice) → display shows "PTN"
3. switch to destination pattern number (hold group + [-/+])
4. [shift] + D to paste

copy/paste a SOUND (pad assignment):
1. go to [sound] mode, select the source pad
2. [shift] + C → display shows "PAD"
3. select the destination pad
4. [shift] + D to paste

tip: copy a pattern before making changes - easy way to create variations
