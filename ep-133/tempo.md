tempo - the speed of your project in BPM (beats per minute)

view/adjust tempo:
press [tempo] to see current BPM

change tempo:
- x-knob: adjust BPM (60-180 visible range)
- hold [tempo] + type number on pads: exact BPM (40-399)
- tap [tempo] repeatedly: tap tempo (set BPM by feel)

metronome:
- y-knob controls click volume
- all the way down = silent metronome

time signature:
[main] + [tempo] together opens time signature
- x-knob: beats per bar (numerator) - how many beats
- y-knob: beat value (denominator) - what note gets the beat
- default is 4/4 (four quarter-note beats per bar)

tip: most music is 4/4, but try 3/4 for waltz or 6/8 for compound feels
