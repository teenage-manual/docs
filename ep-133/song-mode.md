song mode - chain scenes into a full arrangement that plays automatically

note: check your firmware version - song mode was added in later updates

if your firmware has song mode:
1. create multiple scenes using commit ([shift] + [main])
2. access song mode from system menu
3. assign scenes to song positions in order
4. press play in song mode - scenes chain automatically

manual scene switching (works on all firmware):
- hold [main] + [-/+] to change scenes
- or hold [main] + type scene number on pads
- scenes change at the end of the current bar (smooth transition)

performance approach:
many users prefer manual scene switching anyway - it's more flexible for live performance and you can react to the moment
