velocity - how hard you hit affects how loud the sound plays

enable velocity in system settings:
[shift] + [erase] → navigate to PAD → VELOCITY

options:
- OFF: all hits play at the same volume (default)
- HIGH: sensitive - tight touch = quiet, hard hit = loud
- LOW: need to hit harder to hear the difference

when recording with velocity on:
your dynamics are recorded with the notes
playback reflects how hard you originally played

reality check:
ko ii pads are clicky buttons, not rubber pads
velocity feel is limited compared to traditional drum machines

for better velocity control:
use an external MIDI keyboard or pad controller
ko ii responds well to incoming MIDI velocity data
