title: "Sample a Sound"
---

sampling - record audio from the mic or line input into the device

ko ii has 128MB of sample memory with 999 sample slots

how to sample:
1. press [sample] - pads flash, ready to record
2. set your levels:
   - x-knob: input gain (how loud the input is)
   - y-knob: threshold (when to start recording)
3. hold a pad + make sound (speak, play, etc.)
4. release the pad to stop recording
5. press the pad to hear your sample

source selection:
use [-/+] to choose input: mic, line-in L, line-in R, line stereo

threshold explained:
- low threshold: starts recording with quiet sounds
- high threshold: waits for louder signal (ignores noise)
- all the way down: starts immediately when you press the pad

assign to a specific slot:
go to [sound], select a pad, hold [sound] + type slot number (001-999)
otherwise it auto-assigns to the first empty slot

delete a sample permanently:
[erase] + [sound] while on that pad - this removes it from memory
