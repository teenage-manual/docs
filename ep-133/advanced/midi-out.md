title: "Midi Output Per Pad"
---

midi output - each pad can send MIDI notes to external gear

why use this:
- sequence external synths from ko ii
- control DAW instruments
- layer ko ii samples with hardware synths

setup midi output per pad:
1. [shift] + [sound] → navigate to MID page with [-/+]
2. x-knob: MIDI channel (1-16)
3. y-knob: root note (what note it sends)

how it works:
- any sequence recorded on that pad sends MIDI
- if in keys mode, different pads send different notes
- you can combine sample playback AND midi output

example setup:
- assign group D pads to different MIDI channels
- group D becomes your MIDI sequencer
- groups A-C play internal samples

tip: a pad can have NO sample but still send MIDI
useful for sequencing external gear without using sample memory
