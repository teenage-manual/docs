nudge - moves a note earlier or later in time without deleting and re-recording

why use this:
- add human feel to quantized beats
- fix slightly off recordings
- create grooves manually

how to nudge:
1. stop playback, navigate to the step ([-/+])
2. hold [shift] + hold the pad that has the note
3. press [-/+] to nudge forward or backward
4. display shows the offset value

nudge amount depends on your [timing] setting:
- quantize mode: nudges by the current resolution (1/16, etc.)
- free mode: nudges by ticks (finer control, smaller increments)

tip: nudge your snare slightly late for a laid-back feel
