title: "Play Modes (One-Shot, Key, Legato)"
category: "sampling"

play mode - determines how a sound behaves when you trigger it

access: [shift] + [sound] → first page (SND)
x-knob changes the mode:

one-shot (default) - plays the full sample every time
- re-triggering restarts from the beginning
- sample keeps playing even after you release the pad
- best for: drums, one-hit sounds, vocal chops

key (polyphonic) - plays only while you hold the pad
- multiple pads can play at once (chords!)
- releasing the pad stops the sound
- best for: chords, sustained pads, piano-style playing

legato (monophonic) - smooth single-note playing
- only one note at a time
- new notes DON'T restart the sample, just change pitch
- creates smooth transitions between notes
- best for: bass lines, lead melodies in keys mode

panning:
y-knob on this page sets pan (left/right position in stereo)
