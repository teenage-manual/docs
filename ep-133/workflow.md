ko ii organizes your music in layers. here's how it works:

project (9 total) - like a song file, stores everything
- hold [main] + pad 1-9 to load a project
- projects 1-5 have factory sounds pre-loaded
- projects 6-9 are empty for your own stuff

group (4 per project: A, B, C, D) - like instrument sections
- each holds 12 sounds on the pads
- all 4 groups play together as your full beat
- recommended: A=drums, B=bass, C=melodies, D=samples

pattern (99 per group) - a recorded loop
- this is what you create when you record
- each group has its own pattern playing
- hold group button + [-/+] to switch patterns

scene (99 per project) - a snapshot of your arrangement
- remembers which pattern each group is playing
- scene 1 might be intro, scene 2 verse, scene 3 chorus
- hold [main] + [-/+] to switch scenes
- you switch scenes manually during performance (no auto-chain)
