erase - multiple ways to delete notes, patterns, and samples

undo last recording:
[shift] + B (the B button above group B)
- umbrella icon = undo available
- only undoes the most recent action

erase a note while stopped (step edit):
1. navigate to the step with [-/+]
2. hold [erase] + press the pad to remove that sound from the step

erase while playing (real-time erase):
hold [erase] + hold pad - erases that sound as the pattern plays through

erase entire pattern:
hold [erase] + hold the group button until display confirms

delete a scene:
hold [erase] + [main]

delete a sample permanently:
in [sound] mode, hold [erase] + [sound]
warning: this removes the sample from memory entirely, not just from the pad
