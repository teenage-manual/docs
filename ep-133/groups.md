groups are like sections of a band - drums, bass, melody, etc.

the basics:
- 4 groups: A, B, C, D
- each has 12 pads for sounds
- each has 99 patterns for sequences
- all groups play at the same time

switch groups: just press the A, B, C, or D button

recommended setup:
- group A - drums (kicks, snares, hats)
- group B - pass sounds
- group C - melodic sounds, chords
- group D - loops, vocals, one-shots

what's independent per group:
- pattern selection (A can play pattern 2 while B plays pattern 7)
- fader settings (volume, pitch, filter, etc.)
- effects send amount

change a group's pattern:
hold the group button + press [-/+]
