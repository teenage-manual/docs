title: "Master Effects"
---

master effect - one global effect that all groups can send to

ko ii has ONE master effect slot - choose wisely

select your effect:
press [fx] + use [-/+] to choose:
- OFF: no effect
- delay: echo with feedback (classic for dub)
- reverb: adds space and room
- distortion: drive, grit, saturation
- chorus: modulation and widening
- filter: resonant sweeping filter
- compressor: dynamics control, glue

adjust effect parameters:
x-knob and y-knob control effect-specific settings
(e.g., delay time/feedback, reverb size/damping)

send groups to the effect:
1. select a group (A, B, C, or D)
2. hold [fader], press the FX send pad
3. move the fader to control send amount
4. more fader = more effect on that group

remember: all groups share the same effect - you pick one effect type for the whole project
