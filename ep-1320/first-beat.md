let's make something from scratch with medieval sounds:

1. load a project with sounds
   - hold [manus] + pad 1-5

2. explore the sounds
   - press group A, hit the pads
   - this is where your percussion lives

3. start recording
   - press [manus] to enter main mode
   - tap [scribo] - it blinks, waiting
   - tap [ludio] for a 4-beat count-in
   - (or press [scribo]+[ludio] together to start immediately)

4. punch in your drums
   - hit pads in time with the beat
   - press [ludio] to stop everything
   - or press [scribo] to stop recording but keep playing

5. add more layers
   - switch to group B, record bass
   - switch to group C, add melodic elements

6. save your work
   - press [altero] + [manus] (committo)
   - this commits your arrangement as a new scene
