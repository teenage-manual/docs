quantum - controls how notes align to the grid (essential for tight beats or loose grooves)

open timing settings:
press [quantum]

quantize mode (Q) - notes snap to grid:
- use [-/+] to set resolution
- 1/16 is standard for most beats
- 1/8T for triplet feels
- 1/32 for detailed hi-hat patterns

free mode (FREE) - no snapping:
- press [-/+] to toggle between Q and FREE
- notes record exactly as you play them
- good for human feel, but can get messy

swing - shuffle your beat:
- x-knob: resolution
- y-knob: swing amount (0 = straight, higher = more shuffle)

note repeat - instant rolls:
hold [quantum] + press a pad
- repeats at current resolution
- great for hi-hat rolls, snare fills
- record while holding for instant patterns
