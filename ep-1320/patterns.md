pattern - a recorded sequence for one group (your drum loop, bass line, melody, etc.)

the basics:
- 99 patterns available per group
- each pattern can be 1-99 bars long
- patterns are independent (group A pattern 2 + group B pattern 5 = fine)

see current pattern:
hold the group button - display shows the number

change patterns:
- hold group + [-/+] to scroll
- or hold group + type number on pads (01-99)

change pattern length:
hold [scribo] + [-/+] to extend or shorten

empty patterns:
- go to an unused pattern number, it's blank
- record something new there
- your other patterns stay untouched

copy a pattern to make variations:
[altero] + C twice (copy pattern) → switch patterns → [altero] + D (paste)
