ep-1320 uses medieval latin labels - here's your rosetta stone:

manus - main (sequencing mode, where you record and arrange)
sonus - sound (select and edit sounds on pads)
exemp - sample (recording mode for capturing audio)
altero - shift (hold for secondary functions)
faedr - fader (the slider that controls parameters)
quantum - timing/quantize (grid settings)
pocus - effects (punch-in performance fx)
committo - commit (create new scene: altero + manus)
ludio - play
scribo - record
delere - erase

the workflow is identical to ko ii (EP-133)
same structure, same shortcuts, just latin labels and medieval-themed sounds

if you know ko ii, you know ep-1320 - just translate the buttons
