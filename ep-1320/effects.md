master effect - one global effect that all groups can send to

ep-1320 has ONE master effect slot - choose wisely

select your effect:
press [pocus] (without holding) + use [-/+] to choose:
- OFF: no effect
- delay: echo with feedback
- reverb: adds space and room
- distortion: drive, grit, saturation
- chorus: modulation and widening
- filter: resonant sweeping filter
- compressor: dynamics control, glue

adjust effect parameters:
x-knob and y-knob control effect-specific settings

send groups to the effect:
1. select a group (A, B, C, or D)
2. hold [faedr], press the FX send pad
3. move the fader to control send amount
4. more fader = more effect on that group

output compressor (separate from effects):
[altero] + [pocus] → OUT page
adds master compression to the final mix
