title: "Commit (Committo) and Scenes"
---

scene - a snapshot that remembers which patterns all 4 groups are playing

why use scenes:
- scene 1: intro (A=pattern1, B=pattern1, C=pattern1)
- scene 2: verse (A=pattern2, B=pattern1, C=pattern2)
- scene 3: chorus (A=pattern3, B=pattern2, C=pattern3)
- switch between them during performance

committo (create a new scene):
press [altero] + [manus]
- duplicates current patterns to new slots
- creates a new scene pointing to them
- now you can make changes without losing the original

switch scenes:
- hold [manus] + [-/+] to scroll through scenes
- or hold [manus] + type number on pads (01-99)
- scene changes happen at the end of the current bar

delete a scene:
hold [delere] + [manus]

important: there's no automatic scene chaining - you switch scenes manually as you perform
