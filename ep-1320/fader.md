faedr - the physical slider controls different parameters for each group

the fader affects the currently selected group (A, B, C, or D)

select what the fader controls:
hold [faedr] + press a pad to choose:
- level: group volume (default)
- pitch: tune the entire group up/down
- LPF: low-pass filter (removes highs)
- HPF: high-pass filter (removes lows)
- attack: how sounds fade in
- release: how sounds fade out
- pan: stereo position (left/right)
- FX send: how much goes to the master effect

record fader motion:
hold [scribo] + move fader while playing
automation records to the pattern - plays back automatically

visual feedback:
- steady light = currently active parameter
- blinking = has a non-default value stored

reset:
[altero] + [faedr] toggles the stored value on/off
[delere] + [faedr] clears all fader data for the current group
