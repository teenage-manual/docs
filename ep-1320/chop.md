chopping - slice a longer sample across multiple pads to play back sections

why use this:
- chop a drum break into individual hits
- slice a vocal phrase into playable pieces
- turn loops into rearrangeable parts

manual chop (you decide where to cut):
1. have a sample on a pad
2. [altero] + [exemp] - sample starts playing
3. press pads at each chop point as it plays
4. hold a pad to mark the length of that chop
5. press [manus] when done

auto chop (device finds transients):
1. [altero] + [exemp]
2. tap the group button (A, B, C, or D)
3. device detects transients and chops automatically
4. use [-/+] to increase or decrease slice count

fine-tune your chops:
- x-knob: chop start point
- y-knob: chop end point
- hold [altero] + turn knobs for fine adjustment
