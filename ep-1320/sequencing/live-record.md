live recording - play pads in real-time while the sequencer captures what you do

three ways to start recording:

1. with count-in (recommended for tight timing)
   - tap [scribo], then tap [ludio]
   - you'll hear 4 clicks, then recording starts

2. immediate start
   - press [scribo] + [ludio] together
   - starts right away, no count-in

3. start when you play
   - tap [scribo] (it blinks, waiting)
   - hit any pad - recording starts with that note

while recording:
- hit pads to add notes
- press [scribo] again to stop recording but keep playing
- press [ludio] to stop everything

restart from the top:
hold [altero] + [ludio]

scrub through your pattern:
when stopped, [-/+] moves through steps so you can hear each position
