get the best sound from cm-15:

distance:
- 6-12 inches for voice
- closer = more bass (proximity effect)
- further = more room sound

angle:
- speak into the front of the mic
- slight off-axis reduces plosives

built-in stand:
- flip out for table use
- angle towards sound source

use tripod adapter for stands
